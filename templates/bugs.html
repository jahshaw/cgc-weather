  <h2>Feedback</h2>
  <p>Overall I was pretty pleased with the Twilio platform - it was easy to get started by following the copious tutorials, work in a language of my choice, and the console made managing the service itself simple.  Some specific thoughts:</p>

  <ul class="list-group">
    <li>I found some parts of the Twilio console hard to navigate at first - finding info on how much usage I had in my trial account and configuring trial numbers both required a lot of clicking.</li>
    <li>Conversely, some elements of the console were excellent - I had a 'wow' moment when I saw the 'debugger' icon flash red to warn me of problems with my Twilio service, making it very quick for me to find the link I needed.</li>
    <li>Some of the tutorials/API documentation contains code snippets that are out-of-date - irritating but not a big problem.</li>
    <li>I noticed one significant functionality gap when evaluating whether to use the TaskRouter feature - I couldn't see any easy way to re-route a task if it wasn't 'actioned' within a certain time (or perhaps I didn't understand the docs correctly)!  It looks to me like the application would have to handle that logic itself whereas it would be easier if it was built in.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Bugs</h2>
  <p>I found one minor bug in the SMS Dashboard/Voice Dashboard (screenshot below).  The times reported for error events in this view are not correct - they show as having occurred 8 hours ago, although the events occurred a few minutes before the screenshot was taken.  I am in the UK (8 hours ahead of California) so perhaps the UI is erroneously using the local time recorded by a CA-based server?</p>
