  <h1>About App</h1>
  <p class="lead">James built this.  Hire him!</p>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>The CGC Weather app helps members of the Cambridge Gliding Club co-ordinate their activity to ensure they do not travel to the airfield if the weather is unlikely to be good for flying.</p>

  <p>At the start of each day, the server looks up the current & forecasted weather and composes a short SMS announcement to all the students & instructors booked in to fly that day.</p>
  <p>After this initial SMS notification has been sent, the service acts as a message forwarder - students can send messages to the instructors (e.g. to ask if flying is going ahead), whilst instructors can send announcements to everyone flying that day (e.g. to make a go/no-go decision).</p>

  <h2>Demo operation</h2>
  <p>Input the new member data and select 'Start new gliding day' (this is a mock-up).  This will trigger the initial SMS notification to members.  Afterwards, text the service from an instructor and a student and see the messages being forwarded.</p>
